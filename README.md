This is my version of [Microsoft Entity Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/) and "Unit of work" pattern implementation. Made for learning purposes. 
Can be used with MS SQL Server and PostgreSQL.

**Usage**
1. Create a database in MS SQL Server or PostgreSQL DBMS. 
2. Create tables. For example you can run CreateTablesMsSql.sql or CreateTablesPg.sql considering your choice of the DB.
3. Instanciate and use the UnitOfWork class.
